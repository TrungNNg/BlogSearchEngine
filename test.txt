Research Paper Proposal 

My topic of study is about the differences in perspectives of North and South Vietnamese about the Vietnam war. The main research question will be “What are the differences in perspective between North and South Vietnamese?” 

The Vietnam war is not a war between the United State of America and Vietnam but rather it’s a war between Communism in North Vietnamese and the Republic in South Vietnam. The United State of America is a major supporter of South Vietnam hence when most people talk about the Vietnam war they often think about the battle between the United State of America and Vietnam. However the real war is between the North and the South. However this conflict is often not the main topic of discussion for scholars outside of Vietnam. Scholars in Vietnam also do not discuss much about this division, all the history textbooks have always focused heavily on the invader, the United State of America, while skimming or just leaving out completely the discussion about the division of North and South. There is also the possibility of censorship which makes finding the truth difficult for both foreign and domestic scholars.

This paper however, is not an attempt to find the truth about the history events in the Vietnam war, rather is it a study about the perspective and memories of North and South Vietnamese to find out about the difference in perspective and answer question like why there are conflict, where does it come from, what if the effects of this conflict to the life of North and South Vietnamese, how does the conflict still affect people’s life until today.

I plan to explore the different perspectives within Viet Nam about the war. There are perspectives about the enemy, leadership, and the war itself. I can explore these perspectives by comparing and contrasting different language/words used by each side, which I am hoping can be found in newspaper/images at the time. The word and its context from both side can be important to explore more about this topic.

Sources that I plan to use
K.W. Taylor, ed. 2014. Voices from the Second Republic of South Vietnam (1967–1975). Ithaca, N.Y.:  Cornell Southeast Asia Program Publications.
Voices from the Second Republic of South Vietnam includes the perspectives of a wide range of individuals, including soldiers, civilians, politicians, and journalists. These perspectives offer insights into the complexities and contradictions of life during wartime, as well as into the political and social forces that shaped the fate of the Republic of Vietnam.

Even though this is not a history research paper, it’s still important to learn about history which led to the war.
